Pool|Who needs a private Olympic size swimming pool?_Red coloured water is an odd aesthetic.
Sauna|It's nice and steamy in here, too bad I can't stop to relax._There's a weird rust smell mixed with the mist.
Cinema|I have a feeling this isn't used enough for what it would have cost to have in your house. There's a superhero movie playing right now._There's a red stain on the screen and what looks like a murder mystery movie playing.
Kitchen|There are more spices in the spice rack than I knew existed, let alone thought existed._They really need to learn to clean up after themselves, they left strawberry jam all over the counters!
Study Room|There's so many sheets of paper in here on subjects you've never heard of, and a dictionary worth of physics and chemistry equations._Looks like this room was last used for creative art studies, there's red paint all over the room.
Fireplace|You remember that one time you lit the fireplace on Christmas Eve when you were 5 because you wanted to kill santa to steal all the presents, it didn't work._The fire doesn't smell like it's burning firewood.
