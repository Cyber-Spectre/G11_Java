Goose|Honk("I have nothing for you.")~Hjonk("You've got nothing on me.")
Paper Slicer|I wonder how often this is actually used.~The blade looks bent near the end, like it cut through something hard and brittle.

Origami|Looks like someone made an origami goose.~Someone folded this paper into a knife shape.
Kitchen Knife|A fine stainless knife, sharp as broken glass.~The blade seems a little bent around the tip of the knife.
Machete|Why is this in a mansion anyway? Nothing really seems off about it.~It looks slightly tinted red.
Stick shaped like a gun|Reminds me of playing in the woods as a kid.~I have a weird feeling this isn't a stick.
Snowglobe|There's a happy little snowman inside. You decide to shake it vigorously to make him dizzy, you monster.~Someone smashed it and the snowman is missing, who would do such a thing?
Glue|You have a feeling this is here for a reason, unfortunately figuring out why would require a fourth wall break.~Imagine if the item the game is named after was the murder weapon, that would be so funny! By the way there's blood on it.
Country Flag|If only I was good at Geography, I can't remember what country this is the flag of.~This flag is bent along the pole like it was used bluntly, I can't seem to remember what country this flag is from.
Keyboard|Someone swapped the W and N keys, and the T and D keys to spell "NERD".~Someone swapped the F and I keys, and the G and E keys to spell "DIE".

Book of Jokes|There are way too many dad jokes in this.~Someone covered most of the jokes with black ink, the ones that aren't covered are dark humour.

Can of BEANS|"You have become addicted to Pork N' Beans."~A half empty can of beans, it smells like there's something mixed in.

Nuka-Cola(Howard)|Something about a soft drink based off a nuclear weapon both amuses and worries you.~Half of it is gone and it looks like it actually is radioactive.
Dumbbells(Chad)|Someone put some tape on them with one zero written on to make it look like 250kg.~These are legitimately 250kg, whoever can lift these can probably kill someone by patting them on the back.
Tall hat(Dimmadome)|A very tall white cowboy hat, it's very intimidating~The top of the hat looks like it was... sharpened?
